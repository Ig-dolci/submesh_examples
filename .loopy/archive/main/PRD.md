# PRD: FWI-Style Submesh Acoustic Solver with Clayton BC

## Problem Statement
Implement a Firedrake solver workflow aligned with the Full-Waveform Inversion (FWI) demo while preserving this project’s submesh-based extended-domain Clayton absorbing boundary condition behavior.

## Current Baseline
- Codebase size: 10 Python files total, 9 test modules, 58 test functions (source: `glob "*.py"`, `glob "test_*.py"`, `rg "^def test_" --count`).
- Acoustic surface area: 1 solver module (`acoustic_solver.py`) with 2 solver entry points (`acoustic_solve`, `solve_acoustic_submesh`) and 4 acoustic tests (source: `view acoustic_solver.py`, `rg "^def test_" --count test_submesh_acoustic.py`).
- Existing boundary implementation: `Submesh(` appears 2 times and `clayton_labels` appears 5 times in `acoustic_solver.py` (source: `rg --count`).
- FWI orchestration is absent in current solver: 0 matches in `acoustic_solver.py` for `Ensemble|ReducedFunctional|minimize|Control|misfit|gradient|inversion` (source: `rg --count -i`).
- Recent change concentration exists around this area (source: `git log --oneline -20`; multiple recent commits explicitly reference `acoustic_solver.py` and `test_submesh_acoustic.py`).

## Goals
- Add an FWI-capable solver path following the Firedrake demo pattern (forward solve, misfit, gradient, optimization loop).
- Preserve extended-domain submesh construction and Clayton A1 absorbing treatment on outer non-interface boundaries.
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing acoustic API usage and diagnostics.

## Non-Goals
- Reworking unrelated submesh tests/modules outside acoustic/FWI scope.
- Adding 3D inversion support.
- Building production-scale inversion workflows or large-scale data pipelines.

## Users & Context
- Primary user: Firedrake developer/researcher prototyping seismic inversion with submesh coupling.
- Secondary user(s): CI maintainers validating acoustic/submesh regressions.
- Environment: Python/Firedrake (MPI-capable), script-driven local and CI execution.

## Scope
- In scope:
  - Extend solver capabilities to include FWI-style objective and optimization workflow.
  - Keep submesh split (extended + interior) and Clayton BC semantics on extended-domain boundaries.
  - Add/adjust acoustic tests to cover inversion workflow and boundary invariants.
- Out of scope:
  - GUI or visualization products.
  - External seismic data ingestion/ETL systems.
  - Redesign of finite-element discretizations unrelated to requested capability.

## Data Sources
- `acoustic_solver.py`: current forward solve API, submesh labeling, interface and Clayton handling (`view`, `rg`).
- `test_submesh_acoustic.py`: expected behavior for one-step solve and reflective-vs-Clayton comparison (`view`, `rg`).
- Git history: `git --no-pager log --oneline -20` for recent solver/test changes.
- Firedrake reference demo: `https://www.firedrakeproject.org/demos/full_waveform_inversion.py.html` (retrieved via `web_fetch`) for target FWI workflow structure.

## Requirements
### Functional
- [F1] Provide an FWI driver entry point that performs: forward modeling, receiver sampling, misfit accumulation, gradient evaluation, and iterative model update.
- [F2] Include source-time behavior consistent with the reference demo (Ricker wavelet) and support multiple sources/receivers.
- [F3] Preserve current extended-domain submesh construction and coupling structure; Clayton damping must apply only on non-interface extended-boundary labels.
- [F4] Preserve diagnostic outputs for interface/boundary behavior (`interface_label`, `clayton_labels`) and expose inversion diagnostics (objective history, iteration count).
- [F5] Freeze `solve_acoustic_submesh(...)` compatibility:
  - Required call arguments remain `mesh`, `source`, `wave_speed`, `dt`, `t_end`, `boundary_labels` (no new required parameters).
  - Return value remains a `dict` with keys: `mesh`, `extended_submesh`, `extended_domain_label`, `interior_submesh`, `interior_domain_label`, `source`, `wave_speed`, `dt`, `t_end`, `boundary_labels`, `clayton_labels`, `interface_label`, `num_steps`, `solution`, `solution_norm`.
  - `boundary_labels`, `clayton_labels`, and `interface_label` remain tuple-valued diagnostics.
  - Non-2D meshes continue to raise `ValueError` containing `mesh.topological_dimension() must be 2`.
- [F6] Add deterministic tests for: non-negative misfit, objective decrease over optimization, and retained Clayton-vs-reflective norm behavior.

### Non-Functional
- [N1] Performance: small benchmark inversion smoke run must complete within 300 seconds in CI-scale settings.
- [N2] Security/Privacy: no outbound data transfer; all observed/synthetic data handling remains local/in-memory unless explicitly file-configured.
- [N3] Accessibility: API remains script-first with explicit docstrings, typed parameters, and reproducible defaults.

## User Stories (MVP)
- As a Firedrake user, I want an end-to-end small FWI run so that I can validate inversion plumbing quickly.
- As an acoustic solver developer, I want Clayton BC preserved on the extended submesh so that absorbing-boundary behavior remains consistent.
- As a maintainer, I want regression tests for inversion objective trend and boundary-label semantics so that future changes are safe.

## Success Metrics
- Misfit reduction: for a fixed small benchmark, `J_final <= 0.8 * J_initial` within at most 20 optimization iterations.
- Optimizer termination: enforce stop-on-first of `ftol=1e-3` relative objective change, `J <= 1e-8`, or `max_iter=20`.
- Boundary behavior consistency: reflective-vs-Clayton comparison continues to satisfy `solution_norm(clayton) <= solution_norm(reflective)` under equivalent setup.
- Compatibility: all 4 tests in `test_submesh_acoustic.py` pass with unchanged external call signatures.

## Risks & Mitigations
- MPI/runtime instability in tests → keep dedicated CI-scale inversion smoke configuration and avoid long horizon defaults.
- Adjoint integration complexity with submesh coupling → stage delivery (forward+misfit first, then gradient+optimizer) with checkpoints.
- Boundary marker regressions → add explicit assertions for interface-marker and Clayton-label partitioning.

## Confirmed MVP Decisions
- Source parallelism: MVP uses a single-source sequential loop; defer `Ensemble` source parallelism.
- Optimizer stopping: stop on first of `ftol=1e-3` relative objective change, `J <= 1e-8`, or `max_iter=20`.
- Observed data source: synthetic observed data is sufficient for MVP.

## Assumptions
- Target remains 2D-only because current solver explicitly enforces `mesh.topological_dimension() == 2`.
- Current boundary semantics are authoritative: interface labels are inferred; Clayton damping applies to provided outer labels excluding interface labels.
- Demo-aligned implementation may use Firedrake adjoint optimization patterns (e.g., reduced functional + L-BFGS-B) to match requested source material.
- Runtime execution baselines (e.g., wall-clock test duration, pass/fail execution in this session) were unavailable due shell permission restrictions on non-git test commands, so baseline metrics are derived from static code and repository history.
